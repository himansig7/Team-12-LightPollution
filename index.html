    <h2>About My Topic</h2>
    <p>Light pollution is the overuse of artificial light hat brightens the night 
        sky, reducing our ability to see stars and disrupting natural ecosystems. 
        It affects wildlife by interfering with migration patterns, sleep cycles, 
        and predator-prey relationships, especially for nocturnal animals. Humans 
        also experience negative effects, such as disrupted sleep due to exposure 
        to artificial light at night, which can impact overall health. By using 
        shielded lighting, reducing unnecessary brightness, and promoting awareness, 
        we can help restore the natural beauty of the night sky while protecting 
        both wildlife and human well-being.

    <h4>Causes of light pollution:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Glare: uncomfortably bright lights that directly shine into the eye</li>
        <li>Light Trespass: unintended light that spills into other people's spaces</li>
        <li>Skyglow: light scattered into the atmosphere that brightens the night sky</li>
        <li>Light clutter: excessive or confusing groupings of light sources </li>
    </ul>
