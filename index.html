    <h2>About My Topic</h2>
    <p>Light pollution is the overuse of artificial light hat brightens the night 
        sky, reducing our ability to see stars and disrupting natural ecosystems. 
        It affects wildlife by interfering with migration patterns, sleep cycles, 
        and predator-prey relationships, especially for nocturnal animals. Humans 
        also experience negative effects, such as disrupted sleep due to exposure 
        to artificial light at night, which can impact overall health. By using 
        shielded lighting, reducing unnecessary brightness, and promoting awareness, 
        we can help restore the natural beauty of the night sky while protecting 
        both wildlife and human well-being.

    <h4>Causes of light pollution:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Glare: uncomfortably bright lights that directly shine into the eye</li>
        <li>Light Trespass: unintended light that spills into other people's spaces</li>
        <li>Skyglow: light scattered into the atmosphere that brightens the night sky</li>
        <li>Light clutter: excessive or confusing groupings of light sources </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Let's look at the facts...</h3>
    <img src="img/map-progression.jpg" alt="map of light pollution in US overtime"/>
    <p>Levels of light pollution in the U.S. have increased rapidly over the years.</p>

    <img src="img/light-pollution-figure.jpeg" alt="levels of light pollution"/>
    <p>Starlight is greatly diminished, even in rural and suburban areas, impacting both people and wildlife.</p>

    <h3>Lasting Effects of Light Pollution on Wildlife</h3>

    <p>Disrupted sleep and circadian rhythms</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Artificial light can disrupt the natural day-night cycle, which affects 
        when animals sleep, wake, migrate, and reproduce. </li>
      <li>For example, birds that use moonlight to migrate may get lost and die. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Disorientation and poor navigation</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Light pollution can confuse animals' navigation, making it harder for them to find food, shelter, and mates.</li>
      <li>For example, sea turtle hatchlings may be drawn to bright lights from roads 
        and houses instead of the ocean, where they need to go to survive.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Attraction to artificial lights</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Many insects are attracted to artificial light, which can lead to them being 
        killed by light sources or becoming prey for predators.</li>
      <li>For example, billions of moths and other nocturnal insects are killed each year by artificial light.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Reduced survival and reproduction</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Light pollution can lead to reduced survival and reproduction in many species.</li>
      <li>For example, light pollution can affect the behavior of predators and prey, which can alter food webs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lasting Effects of Light Pollution on Ecosystems</h3>
    
    <p>Impacts on predation & reproduction</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Light pollution can attract prey species to areas with artificial light, 
        making them more vulnerable to predators.</li>
      <li>Disrupted circadian rhythms can negatively affect reproductive success 
        by altering hormone cycles and timing of breeding activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Impacts on plant life</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Artificial light at night can trick plants into thinking it's daytime, causing 
        them to bud and flower earlier in the spring, potentially leading to issues with 
        frost damage and impacting the timing of pollination.</li>
      <li>Many nocturnal pollinators like moths and bats are disoriented by artificial light, 
        leading to decreased pollination of night-blooming flowers and decreased seed dispersal.</li>
      <li>Continuous exposure to artificial light can cause stress on plant systems, impacting their 
        photosynthetic efficiency and overall growth. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Impacts on habitat loss</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some animals actively avoid illuminated areas, effectively excluding them from potential habitat.</li>
      <li>For example, nocturnal rodents such as some species of mice and shrews may avoid 
        brightly lit areas, reducing their access to food and shelter.</li>
      <li>When animals avoid lit areas, it can effectively create barriers within their natural 
        range, dividing their habitat into smaller, less viable sections.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lasting Effects of Light Pollution on Humans</h3>

    <p>Melatonin disruption & Sleep problems</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Exposure to artificial light at night, especially in the blue light spectrum, 
        inhibits the body's natural production of melatonin, a hormone crucial for sleep regulation.</li>
      <li>Reduced melatonin levels due to light pollution can lead to difficulty falling asleep, 
        disrupted sleep patterns, and reduced sleep quality.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Circadian rhythm disruption</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Light pollution disrupts the body's natural circadian rhythm, which is synchronized 
        with day and night cycles, potentially impacting various bodily functions beyond sleep.</li>
      <li>For example, a disrupted circadian rhythm can impact hormone regulationâ€” increasing 
        the risk of diseasesâ€” as well as mental health and metabolism, potentially leading to obesity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Potential health concerns</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Studies have linked chronic light pollution exposure to potential health issues like 
        increased risk of depression, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, reproductive problems 
        and cancers.</li>
      <li>Moreover, numerous studies have linked working the night shift and exposure to light at night to 
        increased risks for breast and prostate cancers and other health problems.</li>
    </ul>
