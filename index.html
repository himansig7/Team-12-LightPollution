      <h2>What is Light Pollution?</h2>
      <p>Light pollution is the overuse of artificial light hat brightens the night
        sky, reducing our ability to see stars and disrupting natural ecosystems.
        It affects wildlife by interfering with migration patterns, sleep cycles,
        and predator-prey relationships, especially for nocturnal animals.
      </p>
      <p>Humans
        also experience negative effects, such as disrupted sleep due to exposure
        to artificial light at night, which can impact overall health. By using
        shielded lighting, reducing unnecessary brightness, and promoting awareness,
        we can help restore the natural beauty of the night sky while protecting
        both wildlife and human well-being.

      <h2>Impact!</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>Lasting Effects of Light Pollution on Wildlife</summary>


        <h3 class="impact-header">Disrupted Sleep and Circadian Rhythms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Artificial light can disrupt the natural day-night cycle, which
            affects when animals sleep, wake, migrate, and reproduce.</li>
          <li>Birds that use moonlight to migrate may get lost and die.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="impact-header">Disorientation and Poor Navigation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Light pollution can confuse animals' navigation, making it harder
            for them to find food, shelter, and mates.</li>
          <li>Sea turtle hatchlings may be drawn to bright lights from roads
            and houses instead of the ocean, where they need to go to survive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="impact-header">Attraction to Artificial Lights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Many insects are attracted to artificial light, which can lead to them being
            killed by light sources or becoming prey for predators.</li>
          <li>Billions of moths and other nocturnal insects are killed each year by artificial light.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="impact-header">Reduced Survival and Reproduction</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Light pollution can lead to reduced survival and reproduction in many species.</li>
          <li>By affecting the behavior of predators and prey, light pollution can alter food webs.</li>
        </ul>

      <details>
        <summary>Lasting Effects of Light Pollution on Ecosystems</summary>
        <h3 class="impact-header">Impacts on Predation & Reproduction</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Light pollution can attract prey species to areas with artificial light,
            making them more vulnerable to predators.</li>
          <li>Disrupted circadian rhythms can negatively affect reproductive success
            by altering hormone cycles and timing of breeding activities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="impact-header">Impacts on Plant Life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Artificial light at night can trick plants into thinking it's daytime, causing
            them to bud and flower earlier in the spring, potentially leading to issues with
            <br>frost damage and impacting the timing of pollination.
          </li>
          <li>Many nocturnal pollinators like moths and bats are disoriented by artificial light,
            leading to decreased pollination of night-blooming flowers and <br> decreased seed dispersal.</li>
          <li>Continuous exposure to artificial light can cause stress on plant systems, impacting their
            photosynthetic efficiency and overall growth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="impact-header">Impacts on Habitat Loss</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Some animals actively avoid illuminated areas, effectively excluding them from potential habitat.</li>
          <li>Nocturnal rodents such as some species of mice and shrews may avoid
            brightly lit areas, reducing their access to food and shelter.</li>
          <li>When animals avoid lit areas, it can effectively create barriers within their natural
            range, dividing their habitat into smaller, less viable sections.</li>
        </ul>

      <details>
        <summary>Lasting Effects of Light Pollution on Humans</summary>
        <h3 class="impact-header">Melatonin Disruption & Sleep Problems</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Exposure to artificial light at night, especially in the blue light spectrum,
            inhibits the body's natural production of melatonin, a hormone <br>crucial for sleep regulation.</li>
          <li>Reduced melatonin levels due to light pollution can lead to difficulty falling asleep,
            disrupted sleep patterns, and reduced sleep quality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="impact-header">Circadian Rhythm Disruption</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Light pollution disrupts the body's natural circadian rhythm, which is synchronized
            with day and night cycles, potentially impacting various <br>bodily functions beyond sleep.</li>
          <li>A disrupted circadian rhythm can impact hormone regulation— increasing
            the risk of diseases— as well as mental health and metabolism,<br> potentially leading to obesity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="impact-header">Potential Health Concerns</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Studies have linked chronic light pollution exposure to potential health issues like
            increased risk of depression, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular <br>disease, reproductive problems
            and cancers.</li>
          <li>Moreover, numerous studies have linked working the night shift and exposure to light at night to
            increased risks for breast and prostate cancers<br> and other health problems.</li>
