# Team 12 - Light Pollution Awareness

## Description of the Project

This is an educational project aimed at raising awareness about light pollution, its causes, and its effects on both the environment and human health. This project provides an interactive platform where users can learn about light pollution through visual aids, interactive elements, and detailed explanations. It serves to inform the public about how artificial lighting at night can obscure our starry night skies, disrupt ecosystems, and negatively impact human health.

## Background

Light pollution has become a significant environmental concern, altering natural patterns of light and dark in ecosystems and affecting the visibility of stars at night. This project addresses the need for increased public awareness and offers solutions to mitigate the impact of excessive artificial light.
